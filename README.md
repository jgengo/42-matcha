# Matcha - 42 Project

This project from the 42 School consists in developing a dating site with a list of specific features.

I use docker to make it portable in order to enable me to work on our student-dump, my staff-dump and also remotely.

I chose to learn and use **node.js (+Express)** and thereby discover a new language (**JavaScript**).

## Guideline

- [x] Create two linked docker containers to host Apache, PHP and Adminer on one hand, and MySQL on the other.
- [ ] Think about UI design and CSS framework (bootstrap? materialize? ...)
- [ ] Choose a HTML templating engine (Pug, Haml, Slim, Handlebars, ...)
- [ ] Create User model and all associated functions (create, edit, destroy, show)
- [ ] Create all associated models (Stalk, Like, Block)
- [ ] Create a Geoloc model (force if not given)
- [ ] Create the algorithm that matches people up (taking into account sexual orientation)
- [ ] Create a live chat (using websocket)

## Credits

This is a solo project but some fellow students have inspired me during its realisation and my entire scolarity here at 42. They have written lines of code in my own kernel for life.
