# Matcha - 42 Project

Matcha is a project where you are asked to dev a meetic-like website with some more features at 42 School

I used docker to make it portable and to allow me to work on our student-dump, my staff-dump and also in remote.

I planned to devellop it with **node.js (+Express)** to learn this technology and discover another language (**JavaScript**)

## Guide Line

- [ ] Think about UI design and framework css (bootstrap? materialize? ...)
- [ ] Users Model and All functions (create, edit, destroy, show)
- [ ] All Models (Stalk, Like, Block)
- [ ] Geoloc Model (and Force if not given)
- [ ] Algorithm to match with someone else (with sexual orientation)
- [ ] WebSocket ? to make a live-chat

### It's coming!

## Credits

It's a project supposed to be done alone, but I've to thanks some of my fellows who inspired me during my scolarity and probably has written some lines of code in my own kernel for the rest of my life.
